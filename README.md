# Public

Welcome!

I learn by taking notes and writing down opinions and knowledge.
This repository is a collection of public content related to programming learning projects, problems, computer science and ideas Iâ€™ve explored while learning new things.
Itâ€™s also a space where I share my thoughts and experiences in development, hoping they might inspire or help others.
Feel free to browse or share your feedback!
