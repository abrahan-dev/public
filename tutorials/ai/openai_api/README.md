# OpenAI API

This is a repository with some examples of how to use the OpenAI API that I have made following a tutorial.

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the API key.

Install the dependencies with `npm install`.

Run the examples with `node <example>.js`.

**index.js** is just a very simple example of how to use completions with the OpenAI API.

**chat.js** is a more complex example of how to use completions with the OpenAI API to create a chat.

**qa.js** is an example of how to use the OpenAI API to create a question answering system.

**search.js** is an example of how to use the OpenAI API to create semantic search.
