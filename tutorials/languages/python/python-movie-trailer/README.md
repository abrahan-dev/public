# Movies trailer

ud_movie_trailer is a Python simple project for learning purposes. I get started with oop and other important concepts in Python.

This application shows a list of movies in a browser. You can watch the trailer by clicking on the poster. I have used the library called [Lity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lity) to show the video in a lightbox.

I create the file **greatest_movies.csv** as a data source. It contains the best movies ever, sorted by genre. The program just shows movies having a poster url and youtube trailer url.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository.

## Usage

1. Get into the project folder.
```
cd ud_movie_trailer/
```

2. Make the file **main.py** file executable.
```
chmod +x main.py
```

3. Run the application. Here I am using the interpreter of Python 3.6. A new tab of your browser will be opened.
```
python3.6 main.py
```
