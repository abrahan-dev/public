# Curriculum Vitae

## Summary

I am a **senior software developer** with a focus on web applications.

Since 2012, I have been developing both **backends and frontends** across various industries, including banking, accounting, healthcare, tourism, and risk management. My expertise lies in applying clean code principles to effectively address business challenges.

I frequently work within the **JavaScript ecosystem**, including both front and backend technologies such as TypeScript, Node.js, Bun, TypeORM, Sequelize, Vue, and React. I am also proficient in databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL. The first years of my career I worked extensively with the PHP ecosystem, including frameworks like Symfony, FuelPHP, Zend and Laravel. Additionally, I incorporate AI tools into my daily workflow to enhance productivity and problem-solving.

As a thoughtful, self-driven professional, I am dedicated to problem-solving and constantly improving my skills. I value minimalist, efficient, and **high-quality code**, and I am always eager to learn and share knowledge. While I enjoy collaborating with teams, I also thrive in remote work environments that allow for flexibility and focus.

I am seeking roles with **leadership responsibilities**, such as Lead Developer, Technical Lead, or Junior CTO. I also have a strong interest in positions related to quality assurance and testing. Additionally, I am open to exploring opportunities in related fields that involve management responsibilities.

I am also **open to partnering** with individuals who have innovative business ideas, offering my expertise to help develop and bring those ideas to life.
