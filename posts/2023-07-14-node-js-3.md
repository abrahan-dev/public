# Node.js part 3

[See part 2](./2023-07-11-node-js-2.md)

One of the main advantages of using Node.js is that you can code the whole application in the same language, JavaScript, and that you can use the same language to code the frontend and the backend. If you put a great static analysis tool like TypeScript on top of that you are good to go.

Node.js exposes a [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) like interface for system connections. We can do that through `process`.

```javascript
const process = require('process')

process.stdout.write('Hello world!')
process.stderr.write('Hello error!')
```

We should be aware that under the hoods of `console.log` and `console.error` there is a `process.stdout.write` and `process.stderr.write` respectively (besides other things).

## More on CLI

It is considered a good practice to print some help when programming cli programs.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

'use strict'

printHelp()

function printHelp() {
    console.log('ex1 usage:')
    console.log('')
    console.log('--help                      print this help')
    console.log('-, --in                     read file from stdin')
    console.log('--file={FILENAME}           read file from {FILENAME}')
    console.log('')
    console.log('')
}
```

We can take arguments in with `process.argv` and we can use a package like `minimist` to parse them. We can test the file making it executable `chmod u+x ./ex1.js` and using it like this: `./ex1.js --help --in`

```javascript
var args = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2), {
    boolean: ['help', 'in'],
    string: ['file'],
})

console.log(args)
```

### Read files

If this program needs to work with files, we can use `fs` to read them and `path` to resolve paths.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var path = require('path')

// path figures out the absolute path of the file
var resolvedPath = path.resolve('file.txt')

// fs reads the file synchronously and returns a buffer
// if we pass an encoding as the second argument, it will return a string.
var contents = fs.readFileSync(resolvedPath)
```

An asynchronous version of `fs` is also available. It is a good practice to use the asynchronous version when possible. It is the nature of node to be asynchronous.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var path = require('path')

fs.readFile(path.resolve('file.txt'), function onContents(err, contents) {
    if (err) {
        error(err.toString())
    } else {
        contents = contents.toString().toUpperCase()
        process.stdout.write(contents)
    }
})
```

We can use the package get-stdin to read from stdin.

```javascript
var getStdin = require('get-stdin')

getStdin().then(processStdin).catch(error)
```

### Environment variables

We can use environment variables to pass information to our program. We can use `process.env` to access them.

In that case the env var lives only for the duration of the program.

```bash
NAME=John ./ex1.js
```

```javascript
var name = process.env.NAME
console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
```

An example of the code can be found [here](../tutorials/languages/nodejs/server/cli-1.js)

### Streams

A good resource about streams is [this](https://github.com/JasonGhent/stream-handbook-epub).

We can pipe streams together. We can use `process.stdin` and `process.stdout` to pipe the standard input to the standard output.

We need one readable stream and one writable stream to pipe them together. The result is another readable stream. See [here](https://github.com/JasonGhent/stream-handbook-epub#pipe)

This is much more efficient than reading the whole file into memory and then writing it to the standard output.

We can use a transform stream to transform the data. We can use the `stream` package to create a transform stream.

Here an example give it to me by github copilot:

```javascript
var stream = require('stream')
var util = require('util')

class ReplaceText extends stream.Transform {
    constructor(char) {
        super()
        this.replaceChar = char
    }

    _transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
        var transformedChunk = chunk
            .toString()
            .replace(/[a-z]|[A-Z]|[0-9]/g, this.replaceChar)
        this.push(transformedChunk)
        callback()
    }

    _flush(callback) {
        this.push('more stuff is being passed')
        callback()
    }
}

var xStream = new ReplaceText('x')

process.stdin.pipe(xStream).pipe(process.stdout)
```

We can output the stream into a file.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var path = require('path')

var file = path.resolve('output.txt')
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(file)

process.stdin.pipe(xStream).pipe(writeStream)
```

We can compress a file using the `zlib` package.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var path = require('path')
var zlib = require('zlib')

var file = path.resolve('output.txt')
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(file)

// alternatively we can use createGunzip to decompress
var gzip = zlib.createGzip()

process.stdin.pipe(xStream).pipe(gzip).pipe(writeStream)
```

An example of the code can be found [here](../tutorials/languages/nodejs/server/cli-2.js)

All the stream operations are asynchronous. We may need a way to know when the stream has finished. We can use the `finish` event.

```javascript
function streamComplete(stream) {
    stream.on('end', function () {
        console.log('stream ended')
    })
}
```

We may want to timeout a stream. We can use the package `CAF` to do that.

An example of the code can be found [here](../tutorials/languages/nodejs/server/cli-3.js)

## Database

An example of simple database access using sqlite3.

The code can be found [here](../tutorials/languages/nodejs/server/cli-4.js)

## Web server

An example of simple webserver using `http` and `express`. This is for learning purposes, we have frameworks that handles all the details for us.

The code can be found [here](../tutorials/languages/nodejs/server/cli-5.js)

## Child processes

How to spawn a child process from a process in node. We can use the package `child_process` to do that.

The code can be found [here](../tutorials/languages/nodejs/server/cli-6.js)
