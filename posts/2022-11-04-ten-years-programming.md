# Ten years programming

## Crisis, what crisis?

It has been more than 10 years of programming, and I am not sure if this is really a job apart from the fact that I am paid. I am not completely sure about what are the characteristics of the code that I like either, nor what is a good programmer although I have an opinion.

I have worked mostly in web based SaaS applications. Which is not the same as having spent 10 years doing low level programming or artificial intelligence, so my taste is highly influenced by my environment and the companies I worked for. But I am going to try and summarize a few ideas that I have been ruminating lately. The goal is to know what I can expect of the next 10 years as a developer while discussing the last 10.

## Programming creates the illusion of knowledge

Some people say that the taste is something you can modify and I absolutely agree on that: as I transitioned from omnivore to vegetarian a few years ago, I changed what I liked and I found the process quite subjective and influenced by the illusion of having free will. I am not sure if it is a good analogy, but I mean that programming is not a science and that we canâ€™t prove most of the decisions we take to be true or even good. Very often it is just a matter of taste. And taste changes over time. I am not sure if I am a better programmer. I have just get to know what I do not know.

Writing a book and writing a program could differ very little indeed, in both cases we are applying knowledge that is much bigger than the program or the story. The process of writing a program and the process of writing a book are both a communication process made essentially of words and grammar.

## We are ants

I think after 10 years programming I do not know what kind of code I prefer because my taste is not yet fully formed. I exposed myself a lot to other people's opinions and advice: Twitter and LinkedIn are full of programming _vedettes_ telling what you should or should not do in order to reach the nirvana of programming. The amount of bullshit in this industry is so big that sometimes you just want to stop programming, and I get it. There is no truth in programming and if you ever look for it, you are going to be frustrated. Also, I could easily reduce my 10 years experience to maybe 4 or 5. We programmers spend a lot of time resolving business problems, we are paid to do that most of the time.

We are not paid to polish our tools or to be better at some soft skill or to master some new framework. Something we do not fully get is that programmers are as important as industrial revolution workers were 200 years ago. We truly are ants building a new big step in human civilization but I do not think that any of that is going to last. We are creating the soil on which the new plants are growing.

I feel now that my profession is much less cool than I thought it was when I began.

## Dorian Gray and the end of programming

This is a narcissistic industry obsessed with itself.

I do not think other professionals are in general so enamored of themselves as programmers and tech people in general. Everybody has to have an opinion and social presence and ask for ridiculous wages that nobody else out there is making. But the secret is that programming is not that hard and anybody can self-learn programming and be successful in the field.

At least until now. We are construction workers with hands ready to play the piano. We resolve problems through language. I just do not see that much insecurity, impostor syndrome, burn out and frustration in other professions. And I believe that this profession and its knowledge is going to somehow be dissolved into the general knowledge (basic skill as reading and writing for everybody else) or to simply become useless in the advent of general AI. So I am asking myself, 10 years after, if I should prepare for the end of programming, which is kind of depressing honestly.

It is so much fun programming until now but, if in 3 or 4 years I am going to spend my time reading mostly AI code and producing very little code myself, orchestrating without touching the keyboard, could I call myself a programmer then?

## You are not your next thought

The same way construction workers have their tools we have ours: programming languages, libraries, OS, IDEs, AI, hardware pieces and so on. Whenever we hire a plumber we do not ask for knowledge using a certain hammer or this kind of PVC.

You are not the next library.

Tools are just tools.

Full stack programmers are the best!

## Dogmatism

I have found only one truly gatekeeper in my career, a developer that was somewhere in the middle between clean code and shitty code but, it happens to have a leading role. He had the power to decide wether your code was good or bad. Most of the time his opinions were just that, opinions deployed as a messy, opinionated code. As I said earlier I do not think programming is nothing near to be knowledge or to be scientific, it is more like a flow, a communication stream where subjectivity and very often, the ego, plays a huge role.

I am not saying that clean code is not good or anything, what I am saying is that often leads to create dogmatic, you-are-with-me-or-against-me stubborn gatekeepers. If some programmers chose to optimize for performance good for them. Polymorphism it is not a Swiss knife, and good outputs can be achieved in many ways.

## Burning money you do not own

Everybody seems to be playing the game very well. A lot of money is flowing from capitalists to start-ups that are producing nothing really valuable enough and that are promoting work addiction, toxic environments and tons of the finest ever known corporate bullshit.

It is just amazing to me interviewing with CTOs that are praising the virtues of Software Craftsmanship but, at the same time, are asking you to succeed an algorithms test in 20 minutes. So you want quality but, you want me to pass a live exam which is essentially telling you if I can code fast enough because you are literally burning money you do not own at a pace that is faster than any Scrum velocity you can hire.

## The unstoppable path to abstraction

I think that experienced programmers will be fine the next decade, we may need less junior people as the industry gets more and more efficient with AI.

I do not think that more productivity is going to result in more programmers hired to build more stuff. I think that the opposite is going to happen. We are going to need less programmers to build even more stuff. But hey what do I know about the future? I am just a programmer.

Experienced programmers like me are going to get more management jobs with less programming involved. "Programming" will be more about orchestrating modules through abstractions like AI, and less about writing code directly. In the same way that in the last 10 years, programming is more about orchestrating libraries and APIS and less about writing actual code.

We will see...
