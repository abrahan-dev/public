# Node.js part 1

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Some use cases are:

- Web servers
- Command line tools
- Build tools

Node.js is not the right choice for CPU intensive tasks like AI, ML, video encoding, arithmetic, etc.

## Install

Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage multiple versions of Node.js. Then install the long term support (LTS) version of Node.js.

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

Then verify the version of Node.js.

```bash
# which node
node --version
```

Node comes with a repl (read-eval-print-loop) that can be used to run JavaScript code.

```bash
node
```

We can run any javascript file using node.

```bash
node index.js
```

Alternatively we can use `nodemon` to automatically restart the node process when a file changes.

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

## Globals

Node.js has a few global variables:

- `global`: the global namespace object
- `__dirname`: the directory name of the current module
- `__filename`: the file name of the current module
- `process`: information about the current process
- `console`: a global console object
- `exports`: an object that will be exposed as a module
- `module`: the current module
- `require`: a function to import modules

## Modules

Node.js uses the CommonJS module system by default. But it also supports the ES6 module system.

A module is a JavaScript file that exports an object. It has its own context. It does not pollute the global namespace.

Your code is not global by default. You have to explicitly export it using modules.

This is an example of a module that exports a function using commonjs.

```js
// utils.js
const action = function () {
  console.log('hello action');
}   

module.exports = action;

// index.js
const action = require('./utils.js');
action();
```

We can use the modern approach with ES modules. You need to use the `.mjs` extension to tell node you are using ES modules or use package.json configuration.

```mjs
// utils.mjs
const action = function () {
  console.log('hello action');
}

export default action;

// index.mjs
import action from './utils.mjs';

action();
```

## Internal modules

- `fs`: read, write, update, delete files
- `path`: manipulating paths
- `child_process`: spawn child processes
- `http`: interact with os level networking, useful for building web servers

### FS

It comes with async and sync methods. The async methods are preferred unless you want to block the event loop until the operation is complete.

It also provides a promise based API. Here an example of reading and writing a file using promises.

```mjs
import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";

// it builds the absolute path to the template.html file. __dirname it does not work in ES modules
// template is a buffer, a stream bit by bit of the file 
// we need to convert it to a string using the format 'utf-8'
let template = await readFile(
  new URL("./template.html", import.meta.url),
  "utf-8"
);

// the data we want to replace in the template
const data = {
  title: "A file",
  body: "A body replacement.",
};

for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(data)) {
  template = template.replace(`{${key}}`, val);
}

await writeFile(new URL("./index.html", import.meta.url), template);
```

## Error handling

When an exception occurs the process will exit with `process.exit(1)` while `process.exit(0)` means the execution was successful.

### async errors

The handling can change depending on the code. Using callbacks you can pass the error as the first argument.

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    // throw err;
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

If the error is promise based you can use the `catch` method.

```js
import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";

readFile('file.txt')
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

or use the `try/catch` block as we do with sync code using await.

```js
import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";

try {
  const data = await readFile('file.txt');
  console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

or use the process `uncaughtException` event to handle errors globally. Here we are not catching, it is too late for that. We are just logging the error and exiting the process.

```js
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});

throw new Error('an error');
```

## Packages

Node.js has a package manager called [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). It is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

It allows us to install packages from the npm registry. It also allows us to publish our own packages.

We create a package using the `npm init` command. It will create a `package.json` file with the basic information about the package.

```bash
npm init
```

This command guides you through the process of creating a package.json file. It will ask you a series of questions, and then write a package.json file for you.

It uses semantic versioning [semver](https://semver.org). The version number is composed of three numbers separated by dots. The first number is the major version, the second is the minor version, and the third is the patch version.

Some useful commands:

```bash
# install a package
npm install <package-name>
# uninstall a package
npm uninstall <package-name>
# install a package as a dev dependency
npm install <package-name> --save-dev
# install a package globally
npm install <package-name> -g
# run a script
npm run <script-name>
# info about a package
npm info <package-name>
# use a package without installing it
npx <package-name>
```

## CLI

Node.js can be used to build command line tools. We need to add a `bin` property to the `package.json` file. It is an object where the key is the name of the command and the value is the path to the file that will be executed.

```json
{
  "name": "my-cli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A CLI",
  "bin": {
    "my-cli": "./index.js"
  },
  "author": "John Doe",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Then we need to install the package globally so that the cli command my-cli is registered.

```bash
npm install -g
```

This is an example of a cli that open a random reddit post in the browser. We can pass the flag --print to print the URL in the console instead of opening it in the browser.

We put the _hashbang_ line `#! /usr/bin/env node` at the top of the file to tell the system to use node to run the file. This is just an example:

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

import open from 'open'
import fetch from 'node-fetch'
import yargs from 'yargs'

const { argv } = yargs(process.argv)

const res = await fetch('https://www.reddit.com/.json')
const data = await res.json()
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * data.data.children.length)

const post = data.data.children[randomIndex]

if (argv.print) {
  console.log(`
    Title: ${post.data.title}\n
    Link: ${post.data.permalink}
  `)
} else {
  open(`https://reddit.com${post.data.permalink}`)
}
```

You are not obliged to have a package.json file unless you want to publish it. You can simply create a javascript file, put the hashbang line at the top and make it executable.

```bash
chmod u+x index.js
```

Then you can run it from the terminal.

```bash
./index.js
```

You can use a framework to create cli applications with node as [caporal](https://caporal.io) or [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander).

## Web servers

Node.js can be used to build web servers. It comes with the `http` module that allows us to interact with os level networking.

```js
import http from 'http'

const host = 'localhost'
const port = 8000

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    let body = ''

    req.on('data', chunk => {
      body += chunk.toString()
    })

    req.on('end', () => {
      if (req.headers['content-type'] === 'application/json') {
        body = JSON.parse(body)
      }

      console.log(body)
      res.writeHead(201)
      res.end('ok')
    })
  } else {
    res.writeHead(200)
    res.end('hello from my server')
  }

})

server.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://${host}:${port}`)
})
```

We can use a framework like Express to build web servers. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features.

```js
import express from 'express'
import morgan from 'morgan'
import bp from 'body-parser'

const { urlencoded, json } = bp

const db = {
  todos: [],
}

const app = express()

app.use(urlencoded({ extended: true }))
app.use(json())
app.use(morgan('dev'))

app.get('/todo', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ data: db.todos })
})

app.post('/todo', (req, res) => {
  const newTodo = { complete: false, id: Date.now(), text: req.body.text }
  db.todos.push(newTodo)

  res.json({ data: newTodo })
})

app.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log('Server on http://localhost:8000')
})
```

Servers in node run single-threaded, you can nonetheless balance the load between several threads using modules as [cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html).

You can test your server using [curl](https://curl.se) or [httpie](https://httpie.io).

## Testing

Testing is an important part of software development. It allows us to make sure that our code works as expected.

Let's create a simple function that adds two numbers.

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

Now let's write a test for it. We are using the [assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module from the Node.js standard library.

```js
import assert from 'assert'
import { add } from './add.js'

assert.strictEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
```

We can test using a library like [jest](https://jestjs.io). Assert is good for simple tests but it doesn't provide a good developer experience. For instance it is difficult to read the outputs if some test fails.

```bash
npm install jest --save-dev
```

```js
import { add } from './add.js'

describe('add', () => {
  it('adds two numbers', () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3)
  })
})
```

### Asynchronous testing

An example of a test using jest of an async function.

```js
  test('user does not exist', async () => {
    expect.assertions(1)

    try {
      await getNewUser(3)
    } catch (e) {
      expect(e.message).toBe('User does not exist')
    }
  })
```

## Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a computer program. Node.js comes with a built-in debugger that can be used to debug applications.

```bash
node inspect index.js
```

If you use vscode you can use the debugger integrated in the editor. Create your breakpoints and click run and debug.

Another way is using Chrome DevTools. You can use the flag `--inspect-brk` to start the debugger.

```bash
node --inspect-brk index.mjs
```

Then open chrome and go to `chrome://inspect`. You will see your application running and you can debug it (click the target).

You may need to add the folder.

Sometimes it is enough to use `console.log` to debug your application. That's what I do most of the time. I use the node inspector only when I have a hard time finding a bug.

## Deployment

### Npm package

To publish a package to npm you need to create an account on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com). Then you can publish your package using the commands `npm login` and `npm publish`. It is pretty straightforward.

### Server

You can deploy your node application on a server. You can use a service as [heroku](https://www.heroku.com) or [digital ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) or you can use a cloud provider as [aws](https://aws.amazon.com) or [azure](https://azure.microsoft.com).

Our application needs to have some config ready in the package.json before pushing code to production.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./path/to/server.mjs"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "14.x"
  }
}
```

Do not forget to ignore files that are not needed in production as `node_modules` or `.env`.

```gitignore
/node_modules
npm-debug.log
.DS_Store
/*.env
```
